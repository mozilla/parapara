# vim: ft=jproperties

# webL10n works by loading each of the resources in turn and layering them on
# top. Keys that appear later overwrite those that appear earlier.
#
# As a result, if we have a default language resource it needs to come first or
# else it will clobber everything else.
#
# We use a default resource to represent the English strings since this saves us
# from having to duplicate these strings in the content and in the properties
# file.
#
# We can just put placeholder text in the content and rely on script to put in
# the right values. The one exception is any strings we expect to appear before
# webl10n loads--we should make these same something sensible.
