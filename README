Parapara Animation

Parapara Animation is a workshop to produce a collaborative animation by drawing
pictures on mobile devices such as smart phones or tablets. The objective is not
only to know how animation is produced but also to experience the open-ness of
creating & sharing on the web.

Currently the project consists of two parts:

1. An (client-side) editor for creating individual animations to be added to the
   master animation.
2. A "wall" feature (server-side) which collects and displays the individual
   animations in one master animation.
