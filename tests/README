Parapara UI test suite 
======================

Coverage:
---------
Editor: drawing a path, circle and deleting them.
Wall: none

Software Prerequisites:
-----------------------
- phpunit (unit testing framework): http://www.phpunit.de/
- php-webdriver (php language bindings for Selenium WebDriver): https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver
- Java/selenium standalone server (browser API): http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
- Windows and Firefox

Setting up the Selenium Server:
-------------------------------
The Selenium Server sits inbetween the test code and the browser. It can direct commands to several browsers at once.

After downloading the selenium-server-standalone-x.jar, run from a command line:
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.jar 
Selenium will be able to locate the Firefox binary if it is in a default location

If you have Firefox in a non-standard location use:
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-x.jar -Dwebdriver.firefox.bin="C:\path\to\Firefox"

Running the tests:
------------------
From terminal/command line run:
phpunit SvgCanvasTest.php

The tests will send a command to the Selenium Server to start a browser session and perform the tests.
Until [this bug][https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=702605] is resolved you will need to keep the mouse cursor over the Firefox window while the test is running. Sorry about that!

[Optional]
Setup a Selenium Grid/Server to facilitate cross-browser testing.
If this Grid is on a separate machine, modify the config.inc file to point to the IP address of the grid.
A quick way to get started with a Selenium Grid is to use the Web QA team's Grid framework
